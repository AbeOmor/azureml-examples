    "* Link to Synapse workspace to Azure ML\n",
    "* Attach Synapse Apache Spark pools to Azure ML\n",
    "* Launch spark sessions and prepare big data with PySpark  \n",

When using Azure Synapse, you only pay for the capabilities you opt in to use. During Synapse public preview, there will not be a cost for provisioning an Azure Synapse workspace. Detailed pricing information can be found in this [site](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/synapse-analytics/).\n",
